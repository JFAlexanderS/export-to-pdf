# export-to-pdf
Proof-of-concept of a CSV to PDF script for completing government forms. Created in collaboration with Stanford d.school and Redwood City Courts.

The script works with two .csv and .tex files in the same directory to create a completed PDF for each row in the .csv file. 
The idea is to collect information in a user-friendly format like Google Forms, export the data to a .csv file, then automatically populate the PDF using the script.

The sample .csv included is based on a simplification of form FL-115, available here: https://goo.gl/forms/Y5DoRSEaZG42BiHH3.

export-to-pdf bridges the gap between intuitive information collection formats and official government forms, so I hope it makes your users' lives easier!
